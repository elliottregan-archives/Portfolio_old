              <div class="info visible">
                <p>While working at Startfast in Syracuse in 2012, I had the chance to redesign the mobile app, revoPT. At the time, the app used PhoneGap, so I was able to create the front-end entirely in HTML/CSS/JS. When I first came on board, the developers were using a basic jQuery Mobile theme. The app's performance was suffering due to excessive javascript use and other bulk, so I made the decision to scrap jQuery Mobile, and rebuild the front-end from scratch.</p>
                <p>I did away with as much javascript as I could, relying on CSS transitions for all animations to keep the interface smooth, and make the app feel more native.</p>

              <div class="info">
                <p>This is an example of a login experience I did as an exercise. The problem: users were signing up, but not fill out their profile. I tried to create a simple signup UX that made the process of filling out a profile as easy as possible. It was an experiment in pace as well, as I only gave myself a few hours to complete the project.</p>

                <p>In April of 2012, <a href="http://www.herbsusmann.com/">Herb Susmann</a> and I founded Bear Fountain Design in Geneseo, NY. Starting a company from scratch has been an amazing experience, and I can't even begin to tell you how much I learned in the first month alone. It was what led us to make great connections with local businesses in Livingston Country, Rochester, and Syracuse.</p>

              <div class="info">
                <p>Knight Scheduler is a web-app I developed with <a href="http://www.herbsusmann.com/">Herb Susmann</a>.</p>
                <p>Our goal was to help simplify the registration process for students at SUNY Geneseo by providing an easy way to browse the course listings, and automatically creating schedules based on selected courses.</p>
                <p>Building and maintaining Knight Scheduler has been a great experience working with UI design. We have received excellent feedback from students and administrators alike, and we are constantly in the process of refining the user experience.</p>

                <p>Again, <a href="http://www.herbsusmann.com/">Herb Susmann</a> and I decided that Geneseo students (and landlords) needed a better option when it came to finding housing. At the time of writing this (June 2012), we were in the process of switching servers. If all goes according to plan, we will be running on a shiny new server by the end of July.</p>

              <div class="info">
                <p>The website for the Geneseo Outing Club was the very first project I build from the ground up. </p>
                <p>I wanted to make a unique, playful layout based around the club's theme. This was before I was familiar with Javascript or common layout practices, but I'm still happy with the outcome.</p>

                <p>This is a page I mainly use to play with CSS3 techniques. No promises for valid code, or that it will work with older browsers, but the layout is nice and flexible. This was also done before my Javascript days.</p>
